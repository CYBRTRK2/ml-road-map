Welcome to the **Machine Learning for Software Engineers** repo! [ML for SWEs](https://mlforswes.com/) is a newsletter to understand machine learning engineering and gain confidence building with AI. This repo will contain all hands-on newsletter resources for understanding machine learning engineering and building with AI. Currently included are:

* [The ML Road Map](ml-roadmap/): Learn ML fundamentals for free from high-quality resources.
* [MNIST on MLX](mnist-on-mlx/): Train a simple model on Apple's machine learning framework designed for Apple silicon.

More to come in the future. I plan to write many more articles with accompanying hands-on activities.

In the meantime, these articles are community favorites:

* [Devin Has Exposed a Major Issue with Software Engineering](https://mlforswes.com/p/devin-has-exposed-software-engineers)
* [Machine Learning Infrastructure: The Bridge Between Software Engineering and AI](https://mlforswes.com/p/machine-learning-infra)
* [If you want to learn machine learning engineering, start here](https://mlforswes.com/p/start-here)
* [If You Understand Bananas, You Can Understand Machine Learning](https://mlforswes.com/p/ml-is-bananas)
