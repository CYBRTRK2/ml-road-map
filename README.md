# Machine Learning Road Map Turbo Edition

![ml road map turbo](assets/road_map_turbo.jpeg)

Welcome to the **Machine Learning Road Map-Turbo**. This is the fastest, high-quality road map to get up-to-speed on machine learning fundamentals. It teaches you the prerequisites and machine learning math necessary to understand how machine learning works and build with it. The goal is to quickly get to a point where you can comfortably explore machine learning topics on your own. Many other road maps are more comprehensive, this one is purposefully streamlined.

These resources are aggregated from the best ML educators. I've linked to the authors as much as possible. Please support them. **Feedback/suggestions/corrections** are always welcome and appreciated.

If you're less interested in the technical details of machine learning and want to know more about how machine learning will affect you as a consumer, [I've written an article just for that](https://societysbackend.com/p/ml-is-bananas).

**This road map will be updated as new learning resources are created and new ML topics emerge. It will always remain streamlined.** Let's get started!

## Things to Know Before You Begin

* **Machine Learning will impact everyone's life.** It's a new paradigm of computing that will completely change the way consumers expect their devices to work.
* **Machine learning is a rapidly developing field.** There are many, many area experts because there are many complex fields within machine learning.
* **The best way to understand machine learning is to learn from others who understand the topics you want to know more about.** I've created a list of [accounts to follow on X](https://x.com/i/lists/1738669706595258373). I've also aggregated [a list of newsletters, blogs, and channels](#newsletters-blogs-and-channels-for-learning) I find helpful to stay updated.

Let's get into the resources!

## Free GPUs for Training

This is a list of cloud providers that offer a free tier for machine learning workflows. This is to lower the barrier of entry for machine learning and show that you don't need a powerful local machine to get started. If anything in this list is incorrect, [reach out to me on X](https://x.com/loganthorneloe) so I can make the fix. If there is a cloud computing platform that I've missed, also let me know.

| Resource | Details
|---|---|
| **Top Choices** |
| [Google Colab](https://colab.google/) | Offers free access to GPUs (usually NVIDIA T4 or P100) and TPUs with limited usage time and resources. Excellent for small projects and experimentation.
| [Kaggle Notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/code) | Provides 30 hours/week of GPU usage (NVIDIA Tesla P100 or T4) for free. It's a good option with access to Kaggle's datasets and community.
| **Other Options** |
| [Lightning AI](https://lightning.ai/) | Offers one free studio with 22 GPU hours and is pay-as-you-go after that.
| [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/gpu) | Offers $300 in free credits to new users.
| [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/accelerate-machine-learning-P3/) | Provides a free tier with limited access to various machine learning resources.
| [Paperspace Gradient](https://www.paperspace.com/notebooks) | Offers a free community tier with access to limited GPU resources for experimentation and learning.
