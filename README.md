Welcome to the **Machine Learning Road Map**: A succinct guide to learning ML fundamentals for free!

This streamlined guide will help you:

- **Learn essential prerequisites**
- **Master core ML concepts efficiently**
- **Build a foundation to understand advanced topics**
- **Get ready for real-world ML development**

Unlike comprehensive guides that can be overwhelming, this road map is streamlined and focuses on the most important topics from the best ML educators. The goal is simple: **to get you to a point where you can confidently explore ML topics independently**.

> **Please support the authors and creators of these resources!** Many of these resources had hundreds of hours put into them. If you purchase a book linked in the advanced topics section, don't forget to leave a review after reading it! Reviews are vital for authors to continue their work. I've linked to social profiles throughout the document as much as I could. You can support the creators of these resources for free by giving them a follow and liking their content.

Let's begin your ML journey! 🚀
