# Machine Learning Glossary (WIP)

As I was writing up this glossary, I ran into [Google's Machine Learning glossary](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary). It's a much more effective glossary for a lot of the terms I was going to list here. I recommend checking it out for any machine learning-specific terminology you'd like to learn about.

Instead of building a glossary of my own, I'll focus more time writing about things every machine learning engineer should know outside of terminology. You can find those writings at https://societysbackend.com.
