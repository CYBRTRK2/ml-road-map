This is a list of cloud providers that offer a free tier for machine learning workflows. This is to lower the barrier of entry for machine learning and to prove you don't need a local rig to get started. If anything in this list is incorrect, [reach out to me on X](https://x.com/loganthorneloe) so I can make the fix. If there is a cloud computing platform that I've missed, also let me know.

## Top Choices:

These are my favorite choices for getting started. They offer generous free tiers in a notebook-like structure to make it really easy to get up and going. They also don't rely on working with a single cloud provider.

* [Google Colab](https://colab.google/): Offers free access to GPUs (usually NVIDIA T4 or P100) and TPUs, but with limited usage time and resources. Best for small projects and experimentation.
* [Kaggle Notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/code): Provides 30 hours/week of GPU usage (NVIDIA Tesla P100 or T4) for free. It's a good option for data science and machine learning enthusiasts with access to Kaggle's datasets and community.

## Other Options:

These are other options for more free compute. A lot of these are entry tiers to get you using their AI studio or cloud provider, but they're still worth checking out.

* [Lightning AI](https://lightning.ai/): Offers one free studio with 22 GPU hours.
* [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/gpu): Offers $300 in free credits to new users, which can be used for GPU instances. This is a good option for larger projects or more powerful GPUs, but the free credits may not last long depending on usage.
* [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/accelerate-machine-learning-P3/): Provides a free tier with limited access to various machine learning resources, including some GPU instances. It's a good starting point for exploring SageMaker's capabilities.
* [Paperspace Gradient](https://www.paperspace.com/notebooks): Offers a free community tier with access to limited GPU resources for experimentation and learning.
* [Vast.ai](https://vast.ai/): This is a marketplace where you can rent underutilized GPUs from individuals at competitive prices. It's a good option for flexibility and potentially lower costs, but requires more setup and management.
