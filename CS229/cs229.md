## Stanford's Intro to Machine Learning - CS 229

This course is the gold standard for an introduction to machine learning and the math behind it. It's taught by Andrew Ng, a globally recognized leader in the world of AI. It's entirely **free** and hosted on YouTube.

**It's the best way to get started with an in-depth understanding of how machine learning works.**

I've documented each lecture with the link to the video, the topics the lecture covers, and timestamps to each topic within the video.

Everything you need to know before you get started with this course is outlined in the [prerequisites](../road_maps/modeling_prereqs.md).
