[0:28](https://youtu.be/ORrStCArmP4?si=tuNXtFTiY5NRKgVA&t=28): üéÉ The video discusses principles for efficiently applying machine learning algorithms to solve various application problems.  
[11:39](https://youtu.be/ORrStCArmP4?si=tuNXtFTiY5NRKgVA&t=699): üîç The video explains a workflow for diagnosing and fixing logistic regression errors related to high variance or high bias.  
[17:31](https://youtu.be/ORrStCArmP4?si=tuNXtFTiY5NRKgVA&t=1051): üìâ A high bias problem occurs when a learning algorithm is not fitting the data well enough, resulting in poor performance on both the training and test sets.  
[23:36](https://youtu.be/ORrStCArmP4?si=tuNXtFTiY5NRKgVA&t=1416): üìö The video discusses the importance of selecting the right number of features to fix high variance or bias in a learning algorithm.  
[29:32](https://youtu.be/ORrStCArmP4?si=tuNXtFTiY5NRKgVA&t=1772): üîç It is sometimes difficult to determine if you should invest more time in running an optimization algorithm and one possible issue could be optimizing the wrong cost function.  
[36:12](https://youtu.be/ORrStCArmP4?si=tuNXtFTiY5NRKgVA&t=2172): üìö The video discusses two cases in which Bayesian logistic regression fails to maximize the cost function J.  
[43:46](https://youtu.be/ORrStCArmP4?si=tuNXtFTiY5NRKgVA&t=2626): ‚úàÔ∏è The key lesson is to use a computer simulator to make a helicopter fly by itself.  
[49:02](https://youtu.be/ORrStCArmP4?si=tuNXtFTiY5NRKgVA&t=2942): üîç The video discusses a debugging process using logical reasoning to identify the cause of poor performance in a controller given by Theta RL.  
[55:55](https://youtu.be/ORrStCArmP4?si=tuNXtFTiY5NRKgVA&t=3355): ü§î The video discusses two cases where the problem lies either in the reinforcement learning algorithm or in the cost function.  
[1:08:51](https://youtu.be/ORrStCArmP4?si=tuNXtFTiY5NRKgVA&t=4131): üí° The video discusses the idea of using perfect performance algorithms at different stages of a pipeline to improve accuracy.  
[1:14:35](https://youtu.be/ORrStCArmP4?si=tuNXtFTiY5NRKgVA&t=4475): üîé Error analysis helps identify the difference between current system accuracy and perfect performance, while ablative analysis identifies the difference between current performance and something much worse.
