# Machine Learning Engineer Road Map

This guide is for anyone who wants to become a machine learning engineer. ML engineers are responsible training, serving, and applying machine learning at a large scale. While modelers and researchers focus on model architecture and advancing the performance of machine learning algorithms, ML engineers focus on helping modelers do their job and applying those algorithms to real-world problems.

Machine learning engineers need an understanding of the math behind machine learning (to a lesser extent than modelers, generally) and a strong background in software engineering w/a focus on scalability and reliability.

## Prerequisites for MLE

Before getting into the ML engineering specific content, you'll need strong comprehension of general software engineering principles:

* Data Structures
* Algorithms
* Programmatic Problem Solving
* Writing Clean Code
* Testing
* Version Control
* Code Review
* System Design/Software Architecture

You'll also need a basic understanding of the math machine learning builds upon:

* Linear Algebra
* Probability

You'll also need to know software engineering languages:

* Python (for machine learning applications)
* Low-latency languages (C, C++, Rust, C# are all good to have experience with)

Feel free to skip an prerequisites you already have an understanding of.

### A Computer (required)

Many of these resources include problems for you to solve to help you with your learning. You'll need either a Mac, PC, or Linux machine to run through these resources. I assume you already have this since you've found this road map, but I wanted to make that clear.

### Programming, Data Structures, and Algorithms (required)

Machine learning is part of a field called computer science and requires a basic understanding of programming.

My favorite course to learn programming is Harvard's [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/weeks/0/). It goes through all the fundamentals you need to know, teaches you to think like a programmer, and includes problem sets to help you learn in a hands on fashion. It covers the following topics:

* Scratch
* C
* Arrays
* Algorithms
* Memory
* Data Structures
* Python
* Artificial Intelligence
* SQL
* HTML, CSS, Javascript
* Flask
* Cybersecurity

You only **need** to go up to Week 6 in that course before moving on to Python, but I recommend the whole thing as it's time well spent. If you already have experience with the above topics, you can move on to the next section.

### Advanced Programming

For any of the above coding-related concepts you might not be aware of after taking CS50, I recommened looking for coding resources that can teach you them within the [Ultimate Coding Resource List](https://github.com/Dylan-Israel/ultimate-coding-resources).

### Python (required)
The vast majority of machine learning work is done in Python.

If you've never touched Python before, I recommend [Harvard's Intro to Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/). This is actually a follow-on to CS50 above.

If you have prior experience with it, I suggest [Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python) as a refresher. If you feel comfortable without a refresher, you can move on to the next section.

### C++ (Low-level languages)

If you don't have experience with languages commonly used to build machine learning infrastructure, I recommend taking a the [Learn C++ course from Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-plus-plus). While C++ isn't the only language commonly used for ML infra, an understanding of C++ will go a long way in understanding other languages you may need to know.

### Linear Algebra (required)

Linear algebra is really the mathematical basis for machine learning. If you want to understand machine learning, you should understand linear algebra.

For anyone who dislikes math and is dreading this, linear algebra is very intuitive compared to other maths. I've known a lot of people who really don't like math who have loved linear algebra. It was my only math class I took in college where I was truly excited to learn more.

For this, I recommend the OG online educator [Khan Academy's Linear Algebra class](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra). It breaks things down simply, walks you through concepts, and contains both videos and practice problems.

If you already feel comfortable with linear algebra, you can move on to the next section.

### Probability (required)

Probability is a must for understanding the math behind machine learning and how we represent ideas in machine learning models.

For this, I recommend a lecture within Harvard's CS50 for AI called [Uncertainty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/weeks/2/). It's only 2 hours and does a great job tackling probability and why we need to understand it for machine learning.

If you already feel comfortable with probability, you can move on to the next section.

### Git and GitHub (required)
Anytime you're working with code you should know how to use version control. Version control is used to manage, save, maintain, and collaborate on code while tracking changes to the code over time. GitHub (this website) is one of the most popular platforms for doing this using a version control technology called Git. It's 100% free and a must-learn for anyone building software.

[Learn how to use Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) and [learn how to use GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started). You don't need to run through the entirety of these guides as only the basic are necessary to get started; however, running all the way through each is time well spent.

## Learn Machine Learning Engineering

The next step is to gain a greater understanding of machine learning to understand how you can build with it and to support it. I really like [Google's Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/framing/video-lecture) for this because it's very ML engineering centric and doesn't go too far into the math. It also is well organized, contains practice examples, and extra explanations for key topics.

After completing this course, you should feel comfortable building ML systems. If you're interested in understanding and training models, I suggest running through [CS229](CS299/cs299.md) for a deeper understanding of machine learning math.

At this point, it's best to start building machine learning applications. As you build, you'll run into topics you don't understand. You can use the [extra resources](resources.md)(WIP) section to learn the topics you need to solve the problems you face. You can also check out our [tools](tools.md)(WIP) guide to understand the tools available to help you build applications with machine learning.
