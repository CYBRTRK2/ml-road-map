# Machine Learning Road Map Turbo Edition

![ml road map turbo](../assets/road_map_turbo.jpeg)

Welcome to the **Turbo Edition of the Machine Learning Road Map**. I'm confident this is the fastest, high-quality road map to get up-to-speed on machine learning fundamentals. It takes you through the necessary prerequisites and machine learning math to get understand how machine learning works and build with it. The goal is to quickly get to a point where you can comfortably explore machine learning topics on your own. Many other road maps are more comprehensive, this one is purposefully streamlined and cuts out a lot of fluff so anyone can have the time to learn ML.

This road map contains:
1. The things you need to know before you get started with machine learning.
2. The prerequisites necessary to understand the fundamentals of machine learning.
3. The best resource for understanding machine learning fundamentals.
4. A list of high-quality resources to get started with other machine learning topics.

I am not the author of these resources, they're aggregated from the best ML educators. Please [support them](#support-this-guide). If something is incorrect or missing, let me know.

Let's get started!

## Things to Know Before You Begin

* Machine Learning will impact everyone's life in some way. It's a new paradigm of computer that will completely change computation and the way consumers expect their devices to work.
* Machine learning is a rapidly developing field. There are many, many area experts because there are many fields within machine learning.
* The best way to really understand machine learning is to explore more advanced topics that interest you and learn from others. I've created a list of [accounts to follow on X](https://x.com/i/lists/1738669706595258373). I've also aggregated [a list of newsletters, blogs, and YouTube channels](#newsletters-blogs-and-channels-for-learning) I find helpful to stay updated.
