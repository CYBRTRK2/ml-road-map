# Machine Learning

I've curated the highest-quality resources for learning machine learning entirely for free in a streamlined manner. This guides will take you from prerequisites through important machine learning topics you should understand. It will set you up to dive further into more specific machine learning topics when you're finished.

## Prerequisites

### Programming

Machine learning is part of a field called computer science and requires a basic understanding of programming. Complete up to week 6 in Harvard's [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/weeks/0/) to learn programming fundamentals and how to think like a programmer.

### Python

You have two options:
* If you've never touched Python before: [Harvard's Intro to Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/)
* If you have and you just need a refresher: [Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python)

### Linear Algebra

Linear algebra is one part of the mathematical basis for machine learning. Work through [Khan Academy's Linear Algebra class](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra). It breaks things down simply, walks you through concepts, and contains both videos and practice problems.

### Probability

Probability is the second part of the mathematical basis for machine learning. Go through  a section of Harvard's CS50 for AI called [Uncertainty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/weeks/2/). It's only 2 hours and does a great job tackling probability and why we need to understand it for machine learning.

### Calculus


### Version Control

Anytime you're working with code you should know how to use version control. Version control is used to manage, save, maintain, and collaborate on code while tracking changes to the code over time.

[Learn how to use Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) and [learn how to use GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started). Don't forget to [follow me](https://github.com/loganthorneloe) on GitHub and star this repo once your GitHub account is set up.

## Machine Learning Math

### Supervised Learning



### Unsupervised Learning


### Reinforcement Learning



The next step is to gain a greater understanding of machine learning to understand how you can build with it and to support it. I really like [Google's Machine Learning Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/framing/video-lecture) for this because it's very ML engineering centric and doesn't go too far into the math. It also is well organized, contains practice examples, and extra explanations for key topics.

After completing this course, you should feel comfortable building ML systems. If you're interested in understanding and training models, I suggest running through [CS229](CS299/cs299.md) for a deeper understanding of machine learning math.
