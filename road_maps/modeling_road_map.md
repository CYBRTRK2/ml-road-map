# Modeling Road Map

This guide is for anyone who wants to understand how machine learning actually works. This includes the math behind machine learning and how to train and experiment with models.

This guide can take you from having no knowledge of ML (or programming even) and put you into a spot where you feel comfortable understanding how machine learning works and building your own models.

## Prerequisites for Modeling

Before you begin with the machine learning course, you'll need a basic understanding of the following concepts:

* Programming
* Data Structures
* Algorithms
* Python
* Linear Algebra
* Probability
* Version Control

Feel free to skip any prerequisites you already have an understanding of.

### A Computer (required)

Many of these resources include problems for you to solve to help you with your learning. You'll need either a Mac, PC, or Linux machine to run through these resources. I assume you already have this since you've found this road map, but I wanted to make that clear.

### Programming, Data Structures, and Algorithms (required)

Machine learning is part of a field called computer science and requires a basic understanding of programming.

My favorite course to learn programming is Harvard's [CS50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/weeks/0/). It goes through all the fundamentals you need to know, teaches you to think like a programmer, and includes problem sets to help you learn in a hands on fashion. It covers the following topics:

* Scratch
* C
* Arrays
* Algorithms
* Memory
* Data Structures
* Python
* Artificial Intelligence
* SQL
* HTML, CSS, Javascript
* Flask
* Cybersecurity

You only **need** to go up to Week 6 in that course before moving on to Python, but I recommend the whole thing as it's time well spent. If you already have experience with the above topics, you can move on to the next section.

### Python (required)
The vast majority of machine learning work is done in Python.

If you've never touched Python before, I recommend [Harvard's Intro to Python](https://cs50.harvard.edu/python/2022/). This is actually a follow-on to CS50 above.

If you have prior experience with it, I suggest [Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python) as a refresher. If you feel comfortable without a refresher, you can move on to the next section.

If you really liked Python and want to learn more, check out our [Python Resources](../resources.md#python)

### Linear Algebra (required)

Linear algebra is really the mathematical basis for machine learning. If you want to understand machine learning, you should understand linear algebra.

For anyone who dislikes math and is dreading this, linear algebra is very intuitive compared to other maths. I've known a lot of people who really don't like math who have loved linear algebra. It was my only math class I took in college where I was truly excited to learn more.

For this, I recommend the OG online educator [Khan Academy's Linear Algebra class](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra). It breaks things down simply, walks you through concepts, and contains both videos and practice problems.

If you already feel comfortable with linear algebra, you can move on to the next section.

### Probability (required)

Probability is a must for understanding the math behind machine learning and how we represent ideas in machine learning models.

For this, I recommend a lecture within Harvard's CS50 for AI called [Uncertainty](https://cs50.harvard.edu/ai/2024/weeks/2/). It's only 2 hours and does a great job tackling probability and why we need to understand it for machine learning.

If you already feel comfortable with probability, you can move on to the next section.

### Git and GitHub (strongly recommended)
Anytime you're working with code you should know how to use version control. Version control is used to manage, save, maintain, and collaborate on code while tracking changes to the code over time. GitHub (this website) is one of the most popular platforms for doing this using a version control technology called Git. It's 100% free and a must-learn for anyone building software.

[Learn how to use Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) and [learn how to use GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started). You don't need to run through the entirety of these guides as only the basic are necessary to get started; however, running all the way through each is time well spent.

## Intro to Machine Learning

The next step is digging into machine learning from a beginner's perspective. The gold standard for this is [Stanford's Intro to Machine Learning Course: CS229](CS229/cs299.md).

This consists of 20 lectures taught by Andrew Ng, a global leader in the machine learning space. If you don't enjoy the lecture format, take it slowly. He's an excellent lecturer so it's easier to get through. I'll also be adding exercises soon to practice the concepts he teaches in a hands-on fashion (TODO).

The course will take you from the above prerequisites to feeling comfortable and confident enough to build your own models and understand how they work.

I've summarized and timestamped each lecture with the topics covered. This way you can skip through any part you already know or easily return back to a topic you need to review. **Most people should watch this all the way through, even if some of it is a refresher.**

The course with timestamps and summaries can be found [here](CS229/cs299.md). That document also contains a total list of all concepts covered in the course.

## Advanced Machine Learning

CS299 is definitely the best way to be introduced to machine learning, but the lecture videos above were filmed in 2018, so it doesn't have the most recent advancements. I've found that at this point it's best to find something you're interested in within machine learning and focus on learning that. There isn't any real clear road map at this point.

My suggestion is to find a problem you want to solve with machine learning and work on it. You'll naturally learn the things you need to to solve that problem.

Below is a list of high-quality resources to learn more advanced machine learning topics.

### Multivariable Calculus

Multivariate calculus is used to optimize machine learning algorithms. A good course can be found [here](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/multivariable-calculus). You may need to review the other calculus courses before jumping to multivariable.
