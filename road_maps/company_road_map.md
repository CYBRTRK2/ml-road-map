# Company Road Map

If your company is looking to use the recent advancements in AI within your products or internally, you'll need to find a consultant who can help you do this. While consultants are expensive on a per-hour basis, their benefits far out-weigh their costs if the right consultant is found.

Not all consultants are created equally and not all have the expertise or skillset for certain problems.

A consultant should be able to:

* Understand AI and machine learning
* Be up-to-date on recent AI and machine learning advancements
* Understand the problems you company faces
* Understand the data available to your company
* Communicate complex AI and machine learning topics to you in an understandable way
* Communicate if you company can use AI and how your company can use it
* Create and/or implement a road map for using AI within your products or services or to boost productivity
* Let you know if they won't be able to help and possibly point you to someone who can

If you're looking for an AI consultant, I recommend [Devansh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/devansh-devansh-516004168/). He frequently shares his knowledge of AI by explaining complex topics simply. You can read his writing [here](https://artificialintelligencemadesimple.substack.com/).
