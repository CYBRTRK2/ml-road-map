# Learn From Others
Machine learning is a quickly evolving field. These are the resources I use to stay updated on developments and products.

## X
X is the best place for any sort of tech news, updates, and learning. I've curated [a list of people to follow to learn more about ML](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1738669706595258373?s=20) for you to use as a starting point. You can follow the list and pin it on your feed. I've included people with differing viewpoints on AI because I think taking many opinions into account is the proper way to learn.

## Newsletters
Another great resources are newsletters. Here are high-quality newsletters that won't spam your inbox:
